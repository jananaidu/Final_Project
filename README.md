Automated-Eye-of-the-Cyclone-Detection-model
Overview
The Eye of the Cyclone Detection project is dedicated to automating the identification of the cyclone's center, known as the "eye," within satellite images provided by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). Leveraging a dataset of 150 annotated images, this project utilizes advanced image processing and machine learning techniques to achieve a high accuracy rate of 96.7%. The detection of the cyclone's eye is crucial for meteorologists and disaster response teams to accurately monitor and predict cyclonic behavior.
